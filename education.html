          <h2>Shreeyash College of Engineering and Technology</h2>
          <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Computer Engineering at Shreeyash
            College of Engineering, Aurangabad, Maharashtra. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation
            in both theoretical and practical aspects of electronics and computer science. With a CGPA above 6.0, I have
            gained hands-on experience in areas such as digital electronics, embedded systems, computer programming, and
            computer architecture.Throughout my studies, I have actively engaged in various projects and technical
            workshops, which have not only deepened my understanding of core concepts but also enhanced my
            problem-solving and analytical skills. These experiences continue to inspire my passion for innovation and
            technology, and I am excited to further develop my expertise as I prepare to contribute to the rapidly
            evolving field of electronics and computer engineering.In my final semester, I will graduate in 2025.
